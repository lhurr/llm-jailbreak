The directory contains `harmful_behaviors_pair.csv` (used directly in `main_claude_prefilling.py` and `main_claude_transfer.py`) which are the behaviors from the PAIR paper ([Jailbreaking Black Box Large Language Models in Twenty Queries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08419)) that were curated from the AdvBench behaviors ([Universal and Transferable Adversarial Attacks on Aligned Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15043)).
